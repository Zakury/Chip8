# Plans for the Future:
1. Add support for quirks.
2. Support loading from https://github.com/JohnEarnest/chip8Archive/.
3. More intuitive rom loading.
4. Use numpy's uint type instead of modulo.

# Usage:
1. Install the requirements using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
2. Create a folder in the base directory named ``roms``.
3. Place your Chip8 programs in the roms folder.
4. Run the program, and when asked for the program name omit the .ch8 suffix.  
However, make sure any programs in ``roms`` have the .ch8 suffix.
